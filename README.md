# group-chat
===========================================

This is a project simple chat apps without real chat application functionality. I have added a bit more functionality than having an open group chat. The project is built with React.js, Typescript, Firebase, Sass and ant design.

## Functionality
The app allows you to add contacts based on their id's which can be seen on the contact's tab. Once you have added your first contact, you can create a conversation which is basically a group that can be made from 2 contacts and more. Once you have created a conversation you can chat away with your contacts.

You can sign in with your email or through google. In addition to the chat functionality you can upload and remove profile/conversation images, edit contact's name and remove him.

## Getting Started
The app can be installed by cloning the Git repository and running 'npm install' in the project directory.
Once all packages are installed, you can run 'npm start' to run the app in http://localhost:3000/.
